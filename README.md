## Learning-Oriented Project

World Lab is a learning-first project.

The systems modeled here are **simplifications**, not authoritative simulations.
They are designed to explore ideas, ask questions, and gradually increase in
fidelity over time.

Domain knowledge (biology, ecology, anthropology, climate science, etc.)
is being learned alongside implementation.

Accuracy may improve, assumptions may change, and earlier models may be replaced.
That is an expected and intentional part of the process.

Thoughtful feedback and corrections are welcome, especially when they help clarify
assumptions or suggest more interesting directions to explore.

This project treats simulation as a learning process rather than a finished model.
