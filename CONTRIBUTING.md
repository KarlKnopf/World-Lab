# Contributing to World Lab

Thank you for your interest in World Lab!

World Lab is a **learning-oriented, exploratory project** focused on procedural world
generation and emergent systems. Contributions are welcome, but the spirit of the
project is curiosity, experimentation, and gradual refinement — not immediate accuracy
or completeness.

Please read this document to understand how contributions are approached here.

---

## Project Philosophy

World Lab treats simulation as a **process of learning**, not a finished model.

This means:
- Systems are simplified on purpose
- Assumptions may be incomplete or naive
- Models may be rewritten or discarded over time
- Conceptual clarity is valued over realism or performance

Accuracy and fidelity may improve gradually, but they are not the primary goal at every
stage.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many valid ways to engage with this project:

### Forks & Independent Exploration (Strongly Encouraged)

Forking the project to explore your own ideas is considered a **first-class outcome**.

You are encouraged to:
- Try alternative algorithms
- Explore different modeling assumptions
- Use the project as a learning base
- Take the code in directions that may not fit the main branch

No pull request is required for a fork to be considered successful.

---

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome when changes feel aligned with the exploratory nature of the
project.

Good pull requests tend to:
- Be small and focused
- Introduce one concept at a time
- Favor readability over optimization
- Explain *why* a change was made, not just *what* changed

Not all pull requests will be merged, and that is okay.
Non-merging does not reflect the value of the idea or the work.

### Feedback & Discussion

Thoughtful feedback is welcome, especially when it:
- Clarifies assumptions
- Identifies conceptual issues
- Suggests interesting directions to explore
- Offers alternative perspectives rather than prescriptions

Feedback framed as discussion is preferred over feedback framed as correction.

---

## Domain Knowledge & Accuracy

World Lab explores ideas from domains such as biology, ecology, climate science, and
anthropology. Domain expertise is welcome, but:

- Models are intentionally simplified
- Realism may be postponed in favor of insight
- Corrections may inform future iterations rather than immediate changes

The goal is understanding, not authoritative simulation.

---

## Code Style & Structure

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid premature optimization
- Keep changes readable and well-scoped
- Document assumptions when introducing new models

If a piece of code represents a simplification or placeholder, saying so explicitly is
encouraged.

---

## Final Note

World Lab is a space for curiosity-driven development.

If you are here to explore ideas, learn, or experiment — you are in the right place.
If you are looking for a polished or definitive simulation, this project may not yet
be what you are looking for.

Thank you for engaging thoughtfully.
